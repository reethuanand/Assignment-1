# Assignment-1

RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing), is a sequencing technique to reveal the presence and quantity of
RNA in a biological sample at a given moment. Here we have a dataset of normalized RNA
Sequencing reads for pancreatic cancer tumors.

Data Description : 
The measurement consists of ~20,000 genesfor 185 pancreatic cancer tumors
This means in our data, the row metadata is not present.


AIM : 

Data_frame : It has 18465 rows (Gene ID) and 183 columns (Sample Name/ID)

Stages inculde:

Data cleaning 
Identify only the ​ Exocrine​ (adenocarcinoma) tumors and remove ​ Neuroendocrine​ tumors.
Using PCA for Exploratory data analysis 
Acknowledge the effect of Interferons in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
