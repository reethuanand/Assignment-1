# Assignment-1

RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing), is a sequencing technique to reveal the presence and quantity of
RNA in a biological sample at a given moment. Here we have a dataset of normalized RNA
Sequencing reads for pancreatic cancer tumors.

Data Description : 
The measurement consists of ~20,000 genesfor 185 pancreatic cancer tumors ,
row metadata is not  present and column metadata is only  present ,
Out of 18465 rows, 4365 rows had NULL values at some of the columns.
So after data cleaning 14098 rows are there and 183 columns.
These 14098 rows represent Gene ID, and 183 columns represent 183 different samples.


AIM : 

Data_frame : It has 18465 rows (Gene ID) and 183 columns (Sample Name/ID)

Stages inculde:

Data cleaning ,
Identify only the ​ Exocrine​ (adenocarcinoma) tumors and remove ​ Neuroendocrine​ tumors ,
Using PCA for Exploratory data analysis ,
Acknowledge the effect of Interferons in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.
